# Why this template was needed

```{r set-options, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "readr")

new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

if (length(new.pkg)) {
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
}

if(!require(revealjs)){
  library(devtools)
  devtools::install_github("jjallaire/revealjs")
}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(revealjs)
library(knitr)
library(readr)

options(width = 70)
```

<style type="text/css">
  /* I'm cheating here. The ioslides pipeline wants to treat every h1 and h2
     in a special way, so I can't demo what they look like as a part of a page.
     I'm just emulating it here.*/
  #faux-h1 {
    font-size: 1.5em; margin: .67em 0;
  }
  
  #faux-h2 {
    font-size: 1.2em; margin: .75em 0;
  }
  
  #questions {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 2em;
    padding-top: 1em;
    padding-bottom: 2em;
  }
  
  #wrap {
   width:900px;
   margin:0 auto;
  }
 
  #left_col {
   float:left;
   width:550px;
  }
  
  #right_col {
   float:right;
   width:350px;
  }

## Traditional approach to writing a senior thesis <br> involving statistical analysis

### The dreaded copy-and-paste

> - Import data set into statistical software package
> - Run the procedure to get results
> - Copy and paste appropriate pieces from the analysis into document editor
> - Add descriptions
> - Finish/submit report

---

## Disadvantages of this process

> - Lots of manual work (prone to make errors)
> - Tedious (who likes to carefully copy-and-paste?)
> - Likely not recordable (did you write down all the steps you followed to get your analysis?)
> - What if you made an error at the beginning of your analysis?  If your data had an error?

---

# Reproducible research

---

> "**Reproducible research** is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them."

 > - Roger Peng, Johns Hopkins

---

## Why would reproducible research be <br> of value with senior theses?

> - Updating your code at the very beginning has little impact on all of your analysis throughout the rest of the document
> - Helps you remember how you performed your analysis YEARS down the road
> - Gets you prepared for submitting journal articles that may require revisions
> - Assists in others building off/from your work
> - Companies are moving more and more towards reproducible research/analysis to help with employee turnover/documentation

---

## What is Markdown?

> - A "plaintext formatting syntax"
> - Type in plain text, render to more complex formats
> - One step beyond writing a `txt` file
> - Render to HTML, PDF, etc.

---

## What does it look like?

<div id="wrap">
  <div id="left_col">

```
  # Header 1
  
  ## Header 2
  
  Normal paragraphs of text go here.
  
  **I'm bold**
  
  [links!](http://rstudio.com)
  
   * Unordered
   * Lists   
   
  And  Tables
  ---- -------
  Like This
  
```

</div>

  <div id="right_col">
  <img src="figure/markdown.png" alt="markdown" style="width: 350px;"/>
  </div>
</div>

---

## What is RMarkdown?
  
>- "Literate programming"
>- Embed R code in a Markdown document
>- Renders textual output along with graphics

<div style="height: 15px"></div>

<hr />

<div style="height: 15px"></div>

<!-- Sorry for this hack. I couldn't figure out how to put three backticks in 
    an Rmd without it getting interpreted as a break for <code>, so I have 
    0-width unicode spaces between these inner backticks. Ace (RStudio) will 
    show them as red-dots. Other editors may not. -->

<div id="wrap">    
  <div id="left_col">

```
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
length(x)
qplot(x, bins = 10, 
      fill = I("orange"), 
      color = I("black"))
```
```
  </div>

<div id="right_col">

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, echo=FALSE}
x <- rnorm(1000)
length(x)
qplot(x, bins = 10, fill = I("orange"), color = I("black"))
```

  </div>

</div>

## But then I have to learn R...

---

## Tools to make working with R friendly

> - RStudio is a powerful user interface that helps you get better control of your analysis.
> - Like R, it is also completely free.
> - You can write your entire paper/report (text, code, analysis, graphics, etc.) all in RMarkdown.
> - If you need to update any of your code, RMarkdown will automatically update your plots and output of your analysis and will create an updated PDF file.
> - **No more copy-and-paste!**
> - It's my job!

## What is data visualization?

![Data Cycle](slides-figure/hadley_cycle.png)



# What are the properties of good visualizations?

---

## Tufte's thoughts

Great data visualizations almost always

- include comparisons of multiple variables
- make large data sets coherent
- reveal the data at several levels of detail
- encourage eyes to compare data
- serve a clear purpose
- ... show the data!
- ... don't try to mislead the viewer!

---

## Tukey's quotes

> "The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device."

> "A picture is not merely worth a thousand words, it is much more likely
 to be scrutinized than words are to be read."

# Examples using <br /> `ggplot2` in **R**

### Portland 2014 Departing Flights

```{r pdx}
library(pnwflights14); data("flights", package = "pnwflights14")
pdx_flights <- flights %>% filter(origin == "PDX") %>% 
  select(-year, -origin)
pdx_flights %>% str()
```

---

# Question 1

#### Do flights to Hawaii (from PDX) tend to arrive more than 30 minutes early than flights elsewhere?

---

## How do these "arriving early" flights vary by flight distance?

```{r get_early}
pdx_early_flights <- pdx_flights %>% na.omit() %>%
  filter(arr_delay < -30)
```

```{r early, eval = FALSE}
pdx_early_flights %>% ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

```{r early_plot}
pdx_early_flights %>% ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

---


```{r HI, eval = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
pdx_early_flights %>%
  mutate(hawaii_dest = ifelse(dest %in% c("OGG", "KOA", "HNL", "LIH"), 
                              "Hawaiian", "Not Hawaiian")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = hawaii_dest))
```

---

```{r HI_plot, cache = TRUE}
pdx_early_flights %>%
  mutate(hawaii_dest = ifelse(dest %in% c("OGG", "KOA", "HNL", "LIH"), 
                              "Hawaiian", "Not Hawaiian")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = hawaii_dest))
```

---

```{r HI_box, eval = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
pdx_early_flights %>% 
  mutate(hawaii_dest = ifelse(dest %in% c("OGG", "KOA", "HNL", "LIH"), 
                              "Hawaiian", "Not Hawaiian")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hawaii_dest , y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

```{r HI_boxplot, cache = TRUE}
pdx_early_flights %>% 
  mutate(hawaii_dest = ifelse(dest %in% c("OGG", "KOA", "HNL", "LIH"), 
                              "Hawaiian", "Not Hawaiian")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hawaii_dest , y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

## A non-graphical answer

```{r HI_table}
flights %>% na.omit() %>%
  mutate(hawaii_dest = ifelse(dest %in% c("OGG", "KOA", "HNL", "LIH"), 
                              "Hawaiian", "Not Hawaiian")) %>%
  group_by(hawaii_dest) %>%
  summarize(perc_early = sum(arr_delay < -30) / n() * 100)
```

---

# Question 2

#### Which carrier (departing Seattle) has the worst average `dep_delay`?

---

```{r SEA_summary}
summary_sea_flights <- flights %>% na.omit() %>%
  filter(origin == "SEA") %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay))
```

```{r SEA_bad_barplot}
summary_sea_flights %>% ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

## What happened?

```{r SEA_barplot}
summary_sea_flights %>% ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

---

<img src= "slides-figure/airlines.png" width = "600" />

---

## Stylizing 

```{r sea_highlight}
summary_sea_flights %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(carrier, mean_dep_delay), 
                                   y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", colour = "red")
```

---

## Stylizing (Part Deux)

```{r sea_fill, fig.height = 3}
summary_sea_flights %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(carrier, mean_dep_delay), 
                                   y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "red") +
  xlab("Airline Carrier") +
  ylab("Mean Departure Delay") +
  ggtitle("Seattle Departure Delays for 2014")
```

---

# Question 3

#### How does the distribution of 30 minute+ early arrivals vary for different (meteorological) seasons?

---

```{r full_arr_delay}
flights %>% filter(arr_delay < -30) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = arr_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth = 1, colour = "blue")
```

---

```{r set_seasons}
flights_seasons <- flights %>% filter(arr_delay < -30) %>% 
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(season = ifelse(month %in% 3:5, "spring",
         ifelse(month %in% 6:8, "summer",
         ifelse(month %in% 9:11, "autumn", 
                "winter"))))
```

---

## Ugly first try

```{r bad_hist}
flights_seasons %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = arr_delay, fill = season)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth = 1)
```

---

```{r facet1}
flights_seasons %>% ggplot(aes(x = arr_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth = 1) +
  facet_grid(. ~ season)
```

---

```{r facet2}
flights_seasons %>% ggplot(aes(x = arr_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth = 1) +
  facet_grid(season ~ .)
```


---

```{r season_box}
flights_seasons %>% ggplot(aes(x = season, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

# Formalizing Good Graphics

---

##  The Grammar of Graphics

> - [Wilkinson (2005)](http://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387987746)
     - Created rules/a syntax to describe what makes up all good statistical visualizations/graphics
> - [Wickham (2009)](http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403)

> In brief, the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from **data** to **aesthetic** attributes (color, shape, size) of **geometric** objects (points, lines, bars).

---

## Tidy data!

> - It will be helpful (and good practice) to get your table into a `data.frame` in R whenever possible.
> - Additionally, data should be **tidy**.

![Tidy](slides-figure/tidy.png)

---

## The lingo 

>- **aes**: mappings of the elements in the data to _aesthetics_ we can see on the graphic.
>- **geom**: _geometric_ objects (points, lines, bars, etc.)
>- **facet**: _faceting_ describes breaking the data into subsets and displaying those as "small multiples"

---

## More lingo

>- **stat**: _statistical_ transformations that summarize data (e.g., grouping the data into bins)
>- **scale**: draws a legend and/or axes, specifies at which _scaling_ to view the plot
>- **coord**: almost always the Cartesian _coordinate_ system

---

# R Studio <br> +  <br> R Markdown

---

### Tools to make working with R friendly

> - RStudio is a powerful user interface that helps you get better control of your analysis.
> - Like R, it is also completely free.
> - You can write your entire paper/report (text, code, analysis, graphics, etc.) all in R Markdown.
> - If you need to update any of your code, R Markdown will automatically update your plots and output of your analysis and will create an updated PDF file.
> - **No more copy-and-paste!**
> - It's my job!

---

# Time to try it for yourself!

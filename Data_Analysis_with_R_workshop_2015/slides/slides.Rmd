# Introduction

---

## Installing/Loading packages and data

```{r setup}
library(babynames)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(ggplot2)
library(devtools)
library(broom)
data("babynames", package = "babynames")
```

---

## Structure of the dataset

```{r structure}
str(babynames)
```

---

## What does the data look like?

```{r head}
head(babynames)
```

---

### Is anyone else named "Chester"?

```{r any_others}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Chester") %>%
  qplot(year, prop, data = .)
```

---

## I win!
```{r rivals1}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Chester" | name == "Karolyn") %>%
  qplot(year, prop, data = ., colour = name)
```

---

## What's going on here?
```{r quiz1, eval = FALSE}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Chester" | name == "Karolyn") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(mean_prop = mean(prop), 
            mean_n = mean(n),
            sd_prop = sd(prop),
            sd_n = sd(n)
  )
```

---

## What's going on here?

```{r quiz1_out}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Chester" | name == "Karolyn") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(mean_prop = mean(prop), 
            mean_n = mean(n),
            sd_prop = sd(prop),
            sd_n = sd(n)
  )
```

---

## What about here?

```{r quiz2, eval = FALSE}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Chester" | name == "Karolyn") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  top_n(3)
```

---

## What about here?

```{r quiz2_out}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Chester" | name == "Karolyn") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  top_n(3)
```

---

## That wasn't fair!

```{r mod_rivals}
mod_names <- babynames %>% 
  filter(name == "Chester" 
         | name %in% c("Karolyn", "Carolyn", "Caroline")) %>%
  mutate(kname = ifelse(name == "Chester", "Chester", "KarolynVar")) 
```

---

## What the...
```{r strange_plot}
mod_names %>% qplot(year, prop, data = ., colour = kname)
```

---

### Aw! Boo!

```{r fixed_plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
mod_names <- mod_names %>% group_by(year, kname) %>%
  summarize(sumprop = sum(prop))
mod_names %>% qplot(year, sumprop, data = ., colour = kname)
```

---

## What is R and why should we use it?

 - R is a completely free software package and language for statistical analysis and graphics.
 - It _excels_ in helping you with
      - data manipulation
      - automation
      - reproducibility
      - error finding
      - customizability
- Any downsides?

---

## Like learning a foreign language!

---

### Similarities (In the simplest case)

| R             | Foreign Language  | R examples         |
|:--------------|:-----------------:|--------------------|
| *functions*   | verb              | - sqrt()           |
|               |                   | - arrange()        |
|               |                   | - lm()             |
| *command*     | sentence          | - exp(3)           |
|               |                   | - tail(babynames)  |

**KEY POINT** - Exposure makes you fluent!


---

## Command patterns

### To chain or not to chain...

These two commands accomplish the same thing in R.
```{r chain_or_not, eval = FALSE}
Data_Table %>% function_name(argument1, argument2)
function_name(Data_Table, argument1, argument2)
```

---

## BUT!

Chaining is much easier to read when you want to do a series of steps.

#### Unchained

```{r unchained, eval = FALSE}
filter(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flights, year, month, day),
      arr_delay, dep_delay
    ),
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  arr > 30 | dep > 30
)
```

---

## Versus

#### Chained
```{r chained, eval = FALSE}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  summarise(
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(arr > 30 | dep > 30)
```

---

# More analysis!

---

## Pacific Northwest 2014 Departing Flights

```{r pnw}
library(pnwflights14)
data("flights", package = "pnwflights14")
```

---

## Coming up with questions

```{r pnw_struct}
flights %>% str()
```

---

### Correlation (by airport)

```{r dist_by_arrival_delay}
flights %>% group_by(origin) %>%
  summarize(correl = cor(distance, arr_delay, use = "complete.obs"))
```

---

### Correlation (over everything)

```{r dep_delay_by_month}
flights %>% summarize(correl = cor(dep_delay, month, use = "complete.obs"))
```

--- 

## Simple Linear Regression & Correlation

```{r reg_corr}
flights %>% filter(origin == "PDX") %>%
  summarize(correl = cor(dep_delay, arr_delay, use = "complete.obs"))
lin_reg <- flights %>% filter(origin == "PDX") %>%
  lm(arr_delay ~ dep_delay, data = .)
broom::tidy(lin_reg)
```

---

```{r reg_plot, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 8, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
flights %>% na.omit() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x) + 
  xlab("Departure Delay") +
  ylab("Arrival Delay")
```


---

## t test

```{r t1}
t_test <- flights %>% t.test(arr_delay ~ origin, data = .)
tidy(t_test) %>% rename("PDX" = estimate1, "SEA" = estimate2)
```

---

```{r t_plot, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 8, echo=FALSE}
summary_origin <- flights %>% group_by(origin) %>%
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_arr_delay = sd(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            N = n()) %>%
  mutate(std.error = sd_arr_delay / sqrt(N)) %>%
  mutate(margin.of.error = std.error * qt(0.95/2 + 0.5, N - 1))
summary_origin %>% na.omit() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = origin, y = mean_arr_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_arr_delay - margin.of.error, ymax = mean_arr_delay + margin.of.error)) +
  xlab("Departure Airport") +
  ylab("Arrival Delay")
```

---

## ANOVA

```{r anova}
anova_model <- flights %>% aov(arr_delay ~ carrier, data = .)
tidy(anova_model)
```

---

```{r anova_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 8}
summary_carrier <- flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_arr_delay = sd(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            N = n()) %>%
  mutate(std.error = sd_arr_delay / sqrt(N)) %>%
  mutate(margin.of.error = std.error * qt(0.95/2 + 0.5, N - 1))
summary_carrier %>% na.omit() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_arr_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_arr_delay - margin.of.error, ymax = mean_arr_delay + margin.of.error)) +
  xlab("Carrier Abbreviation") +
  ylab("Arrival Delay")
```

# R Studio <br> +  <br> R Markdown

---

### Tools to make working with R friendly

 - RStudio is a powerful user interface that helps you get better control of your analysis.
 - It is also completely free.
 - You can write your entire paper/report (text, code, analysis, graphics, etc.) all in R Markdown.
 - If you need to update any of your code, R Markdown will automatically update your plots and output of your analysis and will create an updated PDF file.
 - **No more copy-and-paste!**
 - It's my job!

---

# Time to try it for yourself!

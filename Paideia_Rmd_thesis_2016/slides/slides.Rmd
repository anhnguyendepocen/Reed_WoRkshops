<!-- When we think about data visualization, we often think of a static plot with some colors and points.  New tools (spearheaded by Hans Rosling's Gapminder project) are constantly being developed to allow us to interact dynamically with data visualizations.  I'll discuss a variety of different tools that attempt to make data come to life!

All too often statistics is thought of as a boring subject with boring plots.  New software packages and tools are being developed to better understand the relationships between variables.  I'll demonstrate a lot of these different tools and packages using the R computing language.  We'll go through a variety of different examples from multiple fields to better understand anomalies and trends in data.
